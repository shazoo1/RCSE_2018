    "- We can store (very) large collections of data in a traditional file system or in a database system. What are the distinctions (advantages and disadvantages)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer\n",
    "Advantages of DBs:\n",
    "- Uniform access to data\n",
    "- Incapsulation of data storage and maintainance tasks\n",
    "- Special algorithms for data manipulations and searching\n",
    "- Ad-hoc commands, easy-to-use syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of DBs:\n",
    "- Inner logic may be specific to a DBMS\n",
    "- Require extra metadata\n",
    "- Less flexibility\n",
    "- Require extra resources for running database\n",
    "- Perfomance may degradate in case of very large files\n",
    "- Cannot store (actually, can, but poorly) binary data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of file system storage\n",
    "- Very high (usually) perfomance\n",
    "- High compability\n",
    "- High flexibility\n",
    "- Also hides physical level of data\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of file system storage:\n",
    "- No instrumets for data analysis and manipulation, a user has to implement it himself\n",
    "- Higher possibility to break the system\n",
    "- Low-level (return binary data) access to data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing a traditional file system and a database system, we should remember, that database systems are built upon a file system, it utilizes the power of file access, provided at a lower level. It is better to use file systems if you have a binary data and need to implement your ows algorithm to access the data. It would be more useful to use DBs, if you want to store logical data, like integers, strings, objects, also storing its semantic, relations; also you need tools for maintaining these data, and don't have time/intention to do it by yourself."
